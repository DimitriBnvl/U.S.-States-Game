Do you think you can type out the names of all 50 U.S. States? 
Well, as part of Day 25 of 100 Days of Code I dove into creating a game in which the user is tasked with naming the all the states!

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Turtle

## Features
- Compares user's input to a CSV file with the names of all 50 states and their location.
- Plots the name of each state on its location on a map of the U.S.

## What I Learned
This project showed me another way of constructing GUIs in Python using the Turtle module.
Instead of simply adding to my previous experience of moving a "turtle" from one place to another,
I also had to navigate through the Pandas module to move the "turtle" to a location desginated by a CSV file.
